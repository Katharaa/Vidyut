Power failure is concern of people of Kerala. Due to the lack of communication customers are unaware of problems and restoration time.
So we created an application to create a good communication for consumers where they can report and should able to know restoration time.
The application accompanies an IoT device for the automation of the report.The reporting of problem starts from here and it also monitor the power consumption level.
